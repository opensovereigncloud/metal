# Metal-API Enhancement Proposal (MEP)


Changes to the Metal-API code base are often incorporated directly via pull requests which either themselves contain a description about the motivation and scope of a change or a linked GitHub issue does.

If a perspective feature has a bigger extent, requires the involvement of several parties or more discussion is needed before the actual implementation can be started, you may consider filing a pull request with a Metal-API Enhancement Proposal (MEP) first.

GEPs are a measure to propose a change or to add a feature to Metal-API, help you to describe the change(s) conceptionally, and to list the steps that are necessary to reach this goal. It helps the Metal-API maintainers as well as the community to understand the motivation and scope around your proposed change(s) and encourages their contribution to discussions and future pull requests. If you are familiar with the Kubernetes community, MEPs are analogue to Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals ([KEPs]( https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps)).
